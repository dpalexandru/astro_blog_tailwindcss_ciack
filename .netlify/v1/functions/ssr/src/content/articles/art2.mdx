Got just two days off and don’t want to commit to a month-long series?  
Here are the best mini-series and short seasons you can binge in a single weekend:

1. **The End of the F***ing World** – Two seasons packed with dark humor and unforgettable characters.
2. **Unorthodox** – A powerful escape inspired by a true story.
3. **Russian Doll** – A time loop, sharp wit, and lots of personality.
4. **WandaVision** – Superheroes meet sitcoms with a surprisingly emotional twist.
5. **When They See Us** – Intense, moving, and absolutely essential.

Perfect with a blanket and tea… or a giant pizza.
